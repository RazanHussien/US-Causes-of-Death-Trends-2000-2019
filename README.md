# US-Causes-of-Death-Trends-2000-2019
This repository examines US mortality trends from 2000-2019, analyzing causes of death, demographic impacts, and public health insights for informed healthcare strategies.
## Abstract
This repository presents an analysis of mortality trends in the United States from 2000 to 2019, highlighting the leading causes of death across various demographics. The study identifies an upward trend in mortality, with a notable spike in 2017, and emphasizes the dominance of non-communicable diseases by 2019. Through a gender-based analysis, it was found that mortality rates for males and females were comparable, though 2016 marked an unusual increase in male deaths.

## Introduction
The goal of this research is to provide a comprehensive understanding of mortality trends, which is essential for crafting effective public health policies. It explores variations in death rates, focusing on the main reasons people die and how these reasons differ across ages and groups.

## Methodology
Using two main datasets, this study examines the primary causes of death, leveraging SQL for data management and Python for analysis and visualization. It offers an in-depth look into gender-specific mortality differences and trends across age groups.

## Results
My findings reveal a complex picture of U.S. mortality, showing how various factors, including demographic shifts and healthcare challenges, contribute to the changing landscape of public health.
